# Printing functional parts
If you are like me, without ability to print toxic filaments due to living space constraints, you may be in constant search for a filament that can replace ABS/ASA, which is always suggested as **the only** option to print Voron parts. But let me tell you, there are other filaments that will satisfy requirements imposed by Voron designers. I mainly use two filaments that are health-risk free, can be printed in your bedroom and will not give you a cancer.

## Spectrum HT100 PETG

This is supposedly PETG; it looks & feels like PETG, but it prints totally different than PETG. It is quite hard to print it, because it has tendency to warp. I use Bambu X1C with heated chamber (45-50 C) and heated bed at 110 C. The great thing about this special PETG is that it has HDT of 94 C which is even more than ABS! When it comes to material's mechanical properties, it is about the same as PETG. I use it when I need low to medium mechanical strength. It does not shrink, it has excellent dimensional stability and tolerances are as designed. The only issue, as mentioned, it is hard to print.

## Bambu PET-CF

I have just recently discovered this super stiff material - there probably isn't any filament for sub 100 USD that will give you so much stiffness. Use it when you need heavy duty mechanical strength - to print parts such as idlers, XY joints, tensioners, load bearing mounts etc... HDT of this material is astonishing 205 C (more than Nylon). It also prints easily with default Bambu profile. Compared to other "engineering" materials, it has no smell and does not emit toxic fumes. There is only one issue - printed parts have very rough surface. This also affects tolerances, thus for some parts, you'd have to adjust certain dimensions. BambuStudio's feature `X-Y hole compensation` can help you out here.
