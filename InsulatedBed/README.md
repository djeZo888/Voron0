# Insulated bed

If you are struggling with 60W heater, you might want to try to insulate your bed. Some people say this is not a good idea, because it limits your ability to reach high chamber temperature. That may be true, but you can always play fan tricks and resolve this issue. If you have AUX fan or Nevermore, turn it on while heating the bed. If you do not have AUX fan or Nevermore, position your printhead right above the bed in the middle and turn part cooling fan to max while heating the bed.

Things you will need:
- Self-adhesive insulation foam; I suggest 4mm thick, as 10mm may be a bit too much and hard to assemble; get large one - you can cut it in pieces as you like [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002988006154.html)
- Kapton tape; any size, you can cut it to dimensions needed [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005565776871.html)Ä‘

## How to assemble
Cut the foam rougly 120x120 in size and stick it under the bed. Make sure that 3 mounting holes are rougly 5mm in diameter free of foam. Then cut small long rectangular pieces which you use to cover sides of the bed (ALU that is bare). After you have whole bed (apart from top of course) covered in foam, wrap everything in Kapton tape. Again, make sure you do not cover top side of the bed.
