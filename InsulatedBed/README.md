# Insulated bed

If you are struggling with 60W heater, you might want to try to insulate your bed.

Things you will need:
- Self-adhesive insulation foam; I suggest 4mm thick, as 10mm may be a bit too much and hard to assemble; get large one - you can cut it in pieces as you like [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002988006154.html)
- Kapton tape; any size, you can cut it to dimensions needed [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005565776871.html)

## How to assemble
Cut the foam rougly 120x120 in size and stick it under the bed. Make sure that 3 mounting holes are rougly 5cm in diameter free of foam. Then cut small long rectangular pieces which you use to cover sides of the bed (ALU that is bare). After you have whole bed (apart from top of course) covered in foam, wrap everything in Kapton tape. Again, make sure you do not cover top side of the bed.
